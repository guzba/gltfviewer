This repo is for an in-progress glTF model viewer that is written in Nim.

Place models to load into a models/ directory in the project root. Sample models can be gotten from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0

`nim c -r .\src\gltfviewer.nim`

Left and right arrows swap the model being displayed.
